I used TDD for this exercice, here is how I've done :

First write simple test that find all paths from a point. Use a simple map like in the example (function testDiveNode).
Then implement it (function dive)

Update unit test to keep only the longest and steepest path
Modify implementation

Create a new unit test to find the best path on a whole map (function testLongestPathOnSmallMap)
Implement it

It works, now create a last test and pass it the big map (testSkiPath).
Read the result.
